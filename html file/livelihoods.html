             <p class="text-of-livelihoot-bold">US and Engro Foundation restore livelihoods in rural Sindh</p>
             <hr />
             <p>The United States has partnered with Engro Foundation to help over 22,000 flood-affected dairy farmers in the Larkana and Dadu area of Sindh, enabling farmers to keep their livestock healthy and also increased milk production by 0.5 liter a day per animal. The flood-relief assistance is part of a long term, enduring partnership between the United States and Pakistan in the economic sector.</p>
         <p>This supported was delivered through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which provided Rs. 78 million in micro-grants to farmers. Titled ‘Khushaal Livestock’, the project was developed in partnership with Engro Foundation and was implemented by Engro Foods. Assistance included vaccination for animals from foot and mouth disease, veterinary services, fertilizers, multi-cut grass seeds, oat seeds, mineral mixtures and other nutritional supplements to help restore the health and productivity of flood-affected livestock.</p>
         <p>“I am very proud that from the very first days of this epic flood, the United States offered a wide range of support in many of the Pakistan’s worst affected areas,” said USAID Karachi Office-in-charge Paul Sabatine, at the close-out of the initiative. “And when the waters began to recede, and people began returning home, the United States has been working to help restore livelihoods across the affected areas.”</p>
         <p>“The dairy sector is a key driver of economic growth in the region. We are thankful to the American people for supporting Pakistan in recovering from the 2010 flash floods. By assisting farmers in Larkana and Dadu, they played a crucial role in revitalizing the agriculture sector of the area,” stated Deputy Speaker Sindh Assembly, Ms. Shehla Raza during the closing ceremony of the initiative.</p>
         <p>Tahir Jawaid, Vice President, Public Affairs Engro Corp added, “Engro Foundation played a crucial role in the post flood relief and rehabilitation efforts, and we take special pride in our role in the Khushaal Livestock Project. As part of our continuing efforts to assist farmers in Sindh, Engro Foundation will continue to work with USAID to provide market linkages, technical and advisory support, training, and capacity development to dairy farmers.</p>
         <p>To date, the United States has provided nearly $700 million in flood relief and recovery assistance to the people of Pakistan. This included donations of food, water and water purification equipment, medical supplies and services, shelter, and the use of U.S. military aircraft to rescue flood-affected people.</p>

        <p class="text-of-livelihoot-bold">Engro Coal Mining Company responds to researchers' critique</p>
        <hr />   
        <p>In response to a news article, titled “CSR activities cannot hide plight of people affected by Thar coal project”, which appeared in the September 12 issue of The Express Tribune, the Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company (SECMC) issued the following rejoinder.</p>
         <p>The news article quoted Karachi Urban Lab (KUL) director, Dr Nausheen H Anwar and Dr Amiera Sawas, who presented their findings from an 18-month research study involving the Quaid-i-Azam Solar Park in Bahawalpur and the Thar Coal Project on largescale fossil fuels and green energy projects and their impact on land access and livelihoods of ordinary citizens.</p>
         <p>According to the Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company, the notion that Dr Anwar has not been able to see a visible difference in income generation opportunities is incorrect. The company clarified that the majority of employees of Thar Coal Block II are Thari locals. Many of these locals were previously working in different cities and have now returned to work closer to their home towns and families.</p>
         <p>As per data available with SECMC, 75 per cent of the workforce belongs to district of Tharparkar, who earn at least Rs16,000 a month. The second point raised by the SECMC was regarding  the quantification of carbon emissions which the researchers said isn’t possible.</p>    
         <p>This, according to SECMC is a false assumption and misrepresentation of facts. Globally accredited environmental management systems such as ISO 14064 and ISO 14067 are used by SECMC that can help assess carbon footprint for the projects.</p>
         <p>In its story The Express Tribune quoted Anwar as saying that the local media has been implicit in encouraging the discourse that people of Thar are backward, which she termed a colonial narrative.</p>
         <p>The SECMC rejected this claim and added that the researchers should have verified the claim. Another point raised in the story was the issue of future household expansion which the SECMC clarified that unlike current household setups where members of the communities live in a joint family system, the company is providing one household unit of 1,100 square yards to each married couple which suffices the need of one family for the future.</p>
         <p>During the session, the researchers raised questions on the compensation scheme of land and the colonial-era Land Acquisition Act, 1894. To this, the SECMC responded that all land for the project was acquired legally under the Land Acquisition Act 1894 by the Revenue Department of the Government of Sindh, while SECMC helped local land owners to secure up to four times the compensation compared to the land</p>
